To make easier for you to memorize the room name, we use short combinations, usually between 6 and 8 characthers. Considering this a solution for "fast-sharing", the rooms and files will be kept online for only 24 hours. Check it online on memuy.com."

Unlike iSketch, Adivinhe doesnâ€™t use Adobe Flash Player, it was made using HTML5 (canvas) and NGINX/Node.js/MongoDB with Ajax Long-Polling and integrated Facebook login.
